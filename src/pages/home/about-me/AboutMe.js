          I'm a {currentAge} y/o solution-driven Frontend Developer eager to
          contribute to the team's success and to a collaborative work
          environment, finding solutions and determining customer satisfaction
          while meeting the highest standards for web design and user
          experience. I have experience building web applications for desktop
          and mobile for more than {experienceYears} years using HTML/CSS,
          TypeScript, React, Angular across multiple APIs and third-party
          integrations.

          Outside work I like to keep myself busy. Over the years I have
          developed a passion for music and especially playing guitar. I also
          love playing video games, I'm a big fan of From Software games like
          Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Elden Ring. More recently, I discovered
          skiing and became addicted to it, this has become my gateway when I
          need to take a break from my usual routine.
